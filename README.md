# Getting Started with Vite

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and has been migrated to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for improved performance and faster development experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser (or the port shown in the terminal if 3000 is in use).

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).\
Tests will run in watch mode by default. Use `npm test -- --run` to run tests once.

### `npm run test:ui`

Launches the Vitest UI for a visual testing experience.\
This provides a browser-based interface to view and run tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build.\
This is useful for testing the production build before deployment.
