    "title": "Tough Battle Ends in 2–1 Defeat to Southwest Rhinos FC",
    "description": "Our club delivered a spirited and determined performance, but ultimately fell 2–1 to Southwest Rhinos FC in a closely contested match. From kickoff, the team displayed strong intensity, pressing high, moving the ball with purpose, and creating several threatening opportunities. Despite the early pressure, it was Southwest Rhinos FC who capitalised on their chances to take the lead.\n\nThe team responded well, maintaining composure and working their way back into the match. Our goal came through Bibhushan KC, who once again showcased his quality with a calm and clinical finish. His strike brought momentum back to the squad, setting up a competitive second half.\n\nAs the match progressed, the players pushed forward with intent, creating multiple openings in search of an equaliser. The effort and resilience were evident across the pitch, but the final touch in front of goal proved elusive. Southwest Rhinos FC held their ground defensively and saw out the match.\n\nAlthough the result was disappointing, the performance highlighted several positives, including improved build-up play, strong defensive phases, and the growing cohesion within the squad. The team remains optimistic and is committed to bouncing back stronger in the next fixture, carrying forward the belief and work ethic shown in this match.",
